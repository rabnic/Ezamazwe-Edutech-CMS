# Ezamazwe Edutech Admin App

This is a admin facing app for Ezamazwe Edutech. This web application will allow the admin to manage the content on the platform, view the usage of the
platform and also control the tutors that will have access the platform.

## Getting started
Ensure you have Git, Node.js, Firebase tools and stable internet.
  1. Run `Git clone https://github.com/rabnic/ezamazwe-edutech-cms` in your terminal (preferrably where you usually have your projects)
  2. cd into the project `cd ezamazwe-edutech-cms` after successful cloning of the project
  3. Make sure you are inside the project by running `dir` on windows or `ls` on Linux. If you are, proceed.
  4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the project.

### Running the project

Run `npm start` to run the project locally in your browser. It will then open up on localhost:3000, unless another app is already occupying that port.


### Deploying the project

  1. Run `npm run build` to prepare your project for deployment. Builds will be in the `build` folder after successfully building.
  2. Assuming you are using firebase to deploy, Run `firebase deploy`, the configuration file already exists, it will only need to be updated.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Integrations

The application communicates with a Node.js server that is hosted on Render at https://ezamazwe-edutech-nodejs.onrender.com. 
The pages that send http requests to the server are
  1. Login page
     a. The page calls a function in the firebase.js utility file called AdminLogin
     b. The request ensures only admins can access the application, regular users are blocked and get a "Not Authorised" message.  
  2. Forgot Password page
     a. The page calls a function in the firebase.js utility file called ForgotPasswordFunction
     b. The request aims to allow Ezamazwe to have a custom password reset email that matches their brand and a reset page that matches not only their brand but also domains.
  3. Admin management page
     a. The page calls a function in the firebase.js utility file called createNewAdmin
     b. The request creates a new user as an admin with an autogenerated password, and sends them an email with a link to the platform and the password. On first sign in it forces them to reset the password.
