# Ezamazwe Edutech Admin App

This is a admin facing app for Ezamazwe Edutech. This web application will allow the admin to manage the content on the platform, view the usage of the
platform and also control the tutors that will have access the platform.

## Getting started
Ensure you have Git, Node.js, Firebase tools and stable internet.
  1. Run `Git clone https://github.com/rabnic/ezamazwe-edutech-cms` in your terminal (preferrably where you usually have your projects)
  2. cd into the project `cd ezamazwe-edutech-cms` after successful cloning of the project
  3. Make sure you are inside the project by running `dir` on windows or `ls` on Linux. If you are, proceed.
  4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies for the project.

### Running the project

Run `npm start` to run the project locally in your browser. It will then open up on localhost:3000, unless another app is already occupying that port.


### Deploying the project

  1. Run `npm run build` to prepare your project for deployment. Builds will be in the `build` folder after successfully building.
  2. Assuming you are using firebase to deploy, Run `firebase deploy`, the configuration file already exists, it will only need to be updated.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
